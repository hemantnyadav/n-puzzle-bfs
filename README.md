# n-puzzle-bfs
implementation of n-puzzle game

1. Input initial state as list L
2. Check if given L it is solvalbe
    - This can be done using "number of inversions should be even"
    - functions used for this are solvable and inv_num
3. Appy BFS as follows
    - Add initial state to Q(FIFO queue)
    - Explore all possible move from first state in Q and compare it with goal
    - if goal is matched return
    - else check Q for next state for exploration
